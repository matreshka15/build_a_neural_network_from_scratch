Welcome to the Neural Network Part!
================

In this part, if you download the *.ipynb file, do please download the testCase file too.  
testCase file is developed by professor Ng in his Coursera's deep learning course, which is used for debugging.  
The *.py file alone does't need the testCase file.

## How to use?
Let's be straight.
* If you wanna learning how to program a logistic regression ,just open the neural_networks.ipynb file    
(p.s. it's recommended to have some basic knowlegdge about machine learning, and you may find pdf notes usable.)
* If you wanna use a python library to faster your coding, just download the .py file!
* A copy of personal notes have been uploaded, so if you find it hard to understand some parts of the code, refer to these notes!
