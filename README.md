build_a_neural_network_from_scratch
================
Note:This project is in its initial state, which means all the libs and jupyter notebooks uploaded is usable, but it doesn't cover all the areas of deep learning. We're still trying to make it a better and more thorough lib.  
This is a project of a college student, so if you like the repo, please star it!   
Your support will inspire me to make this project better!

Anyway, this is both a deep learning tutorial and a deep learning python lib.  
-------

## How to use?
As the title indicated, you can use the repo as a tutorial of how to build a neural network, as well as a handy python lib to faster your implementation of machine learning programs.    
Each directory includes corresponding files as its title. For instance, in the directory 'logistic_regression', what you will see is as below:  
* a jupyter notebook file, which shows the whole process of implementing a computing unit(that is, a logistic regression function)
* a *.py file, which is the python library of functions, which can help you build your own logistic regression faster

## Other libraries required
These are some other libraries required to run neural network codes on your terminal.  
You can use pip to install them. For example,you can input 'sudo pip3 install numpy' on your terminal to install numpy lib.  
* Numpy  
-As indicated before, this is a 'must-have' stuff of almost all machine learning python programs.Its can vectorize the implementation, which can boost up the robustness and speed up your code.
* matplotlib  
-This is a library which can enable you to draw bar\scatter plots and so on in an efficient way. If you're familiar with malab, you'll be happy to use this, I promise.But if you're not, it's totally okay, because almost all the codes have been done for you.
* sklearn  
-Sometimes we'll use this lib to split up datasets,etc.
